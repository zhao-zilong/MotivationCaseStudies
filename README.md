# Motivation Case Studies

Off-line training with dirty label data with varying noise level from 0% to 100%. For the IoT attacks (thermostat) dataset and Cluster task failures detection (task) datasets, all experiments are repeated 10 times. For the face dataset with MLP algorithm, we repeat experiments 10 times. For the face dataset with VGG algorithm, we repeat experiments 3 times due to the higher training time. The experiments using nearest centroid  on the task dataset have greatly varying results between runs. We repeat these experiments 100 times.

All intermediate and final results are shown in the `assessement_*.ipynb` files. The face dataset has two separated files for MLP and VGG.
To reproduce the results, the datasets are available on [google drive.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VKeYKg_0jsi4Vb6GFTaHuCLHWqwO3eZ6/view?usp=sharing)
